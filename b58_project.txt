Project Details
---------------
Project Title: Notepad--

Project Description: A notepad style machine which translates keyboard input onto a VGA monitor.

serve as a useful resource for future development): https://github.com/armitag8/ASIC_Notepad--
 


Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
The ASIC will have the ability to print simple characters (A-Z, 
0-9) through the VGA in arbitrary positions using switches on 
the DE2 as input. Each character will fill the same dimensions, 
with no kerning, spacing or vertical alignment encoded. The 
colour or each character may also be selected.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
The ASIC  will now accept individual characters with no position 
information and print them through the VGA to the next available 
position, beginning from the top-left corner, and proceeding in 
normal latin left-to-right then top-to-bottom order. 
Additionally, instead of taking input from the DE2 switches, the 
ASIC will now take input from a keyboard connected via the DE2's 
PS/2 port.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
The ASIC will now be capable of overwriting previous characters 
displayed on the screen, using the Backspace key, as well as 
posess carriage return / line feed functionality. Time-
dependant, additional features that could be included are:
- A flashing cursor to enable overwriting at the selected position (navigation with arrow keys)
- Rudimentary line-copy and line-paste
- The ability to write special characters, such braces, brackets, colons, etc.
- ^The same, with lowercase letters
- Multiple 'pages', scrolling

What is your backup plan if things donâ€™t work out as planned?
As this project has many features that are not necessary for a 
rudimentary text editor, each can be omitted, if time is overly 
constrained.

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board 
In addition to a display with VGA input,  a keyboard with PS/2 
output  is required for this project.

Updates
-------

<Example update. Delte this and add your own updates after each lab session>
Week 1: We built the hardware and tested the sensors. The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as
expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead
we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead. Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept
getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the
high score feature, have updated that in the project description as (optional).
